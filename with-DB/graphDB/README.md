#Implementation using Neo4j

Algorithms currently in use:  
 - [k-NN with cosine similarity][1]  

**Setup**  
Before doing anything else, first do these steps:  
 - Copy `paths.py.sample` to another file `paths.py` and change the variables in `paths.py` according to your system  
 - Generate a sample graph database: go to `setup_sample_graph/` and read the instructions  

**Requirements**  
 - Neo4j
 - Python 2  

**To-Do**  
 - Implement more algorithms
